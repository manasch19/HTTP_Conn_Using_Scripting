# HTTP_Conn_Using_Scripting

This script includes creating a connection using http and sending parameters using Query Parameters.
Using the parameter max items it gets the documents out ofthe the total documents and loops based on the rstotal coming from the http response.
This logic loops until all the documents are queried from the http.
